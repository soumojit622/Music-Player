Custom Music Player in HTML CSS &amp; JavaScript

In this project, I have shown how to create a custom music player using html css & javascript.
This music player has several features like we can loop, repeat or shuffle a song, play/pause a song or play the next or previous song.
We can view our songs list and also know which song is currently playing and we can also select the song from the list to play.
